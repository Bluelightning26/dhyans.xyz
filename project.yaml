    - name: Reach the End! (Multiplayer) Game designed for the Sprig Console!
      language: Javascript
      description: >
        Fight your way to the opposing player's end-zone while they push back,
        the twine will get shorter with more pushes when your opponent is in their own end-zone.
        To prevent your opponent from ruthlessly pushing you, freeze their controls!
        This can be done five times by each player and lasts half a second.
        This is a two player game,
        designed to be simple while taking advantage of the Sprigâ€™s layout.
