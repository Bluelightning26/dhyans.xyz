# My Website!

***
## My first personal website with a custom domain!

Unlike my websites of the past, this one looks decent in my opinion.

I learned a lot about web hosting when developing this, 
and how CloudFlare and Gmail work on a deeper level. 
I am excited to expand on this in the future,
and is the first web project I am really excited about.
(I normally stick to languages like Java :P)

## Features
- Custom .xyz domain
- Custom email addresses
- Custom Subdomains: ex. [winter.dhyans.xyz](https://winter.dhyans.xyz)
- Cool Fonts from Google Fonts
- SVG Icons
  - All with -i8 in the icon name are from icons8.com !
- HTML Custom Tags with CSS (I didn't know this was possible before!)

## Future
I will keep expanding on the project as I am finding it fun to try new things and 
experiment through design, something that is not too common in Java.
