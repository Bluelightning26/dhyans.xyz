# My Website!

***
## My first personal website with a custom domain!

Unlike my websites of the past, this one looks decent in my opinion.

I learned a lot about web hosting when developing this, 
and how CloudFlare and Gmail work on a deeper level. 
I am excited to expand on this in the future,
and is the first web project I am really excited about.
(I normally stick to languages like Java :P)

## Features
- Custom .xyz domain
- Basic protections from CloudFlare
- Custom email addresses
-  All received emails will be scanned by DuckDuckGo
- Custom Subdomains: ex. [winter.dhyans.xyz](https://winter.dhyans.xyz)
- Cool Fonts from Google Fonts
- SVG Icons
  - All with -i8 in the icon name are from icons8.com !
- HTML Custom Tags with CSS (I didn't know this was possible before!)
- Color changing buttons
- Links to headings
- 404 Page!


## Future
I will keep expanding on the project as I am finding it fun to try new things and 
experiment through design, something that is not too common in Java.

More sites for various topics will be hosted on subdomains on my website!
